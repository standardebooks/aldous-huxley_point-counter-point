				<p>The air was rough, I forgot the <i xml:lang="fr">Quiés</i> for my ears and was in a Hell of Noise for 2½ hours. Feeling very tired and consequently, sweet Walter, rather sentimental and <i xml:lang="fr">sola sola</i>. Why aren’t you here to console me for the unbearable sadness of this lovely evening outside my window? The Louvre, the river, the green glass sky, the sunlight and those velvet shadows⁠—they make me feel like bursting into tears. And not the scenery only. My arms in the sleeves of my dressing gown, my handwriting, even my bare toes, now that I’ve dropped my slippers⁠—terrible, terrible. And as for my face in the glass, and my shoulders, and the orange roses and the Chinese goldfish to match, and the Dufy curtains and all the rest⁠—yes, <em>all</em>, because everything’s equally beautiful and extraordinary, even the things that are dull and ugly⁠—they’re too much to be borne. Too much. I can’t stand it and what’s more, I won’t. Interval of 5 minutes. That’s why I’ve telephoned to René Tallemant to come and have a cocktail and take me out somewhere amusing, malgré my headache. I simply won’t let myself be bullied by the universe. Do you know René? Rather a divine little man. But I wish it were you, all the same. Must go and put on a few clothes. <i xml:lang="fr">À toi.</i></p>

				<p>Your letter was tiresome. Such yammering. And it isn’t flattering to be called a poison in the blood. It’s the equivalent of being called a stomach ache. If you can’t write more sensibly, don’t write at all. <i xml:lang="fr">Quant à moi, je m’amuse. Pas follement.</i> But sufficiently, sufficiently. Theatres: mostly bad, but I like them; I’m still childish enough to feel involved in the imbecile plots. And buying clothes; such ravishments! I simply adored myself in Lanvin’s looking-glasses. Looking at pictures, on the other hand, is an overrated sport. Not dancing, though. There’d be some point, if life were always like dancing with a professional. But it ain’t. And if it were, I dare say one would long to walk. In the evenings a little pub-crawling in Mont Parnasse through hordes of Americans, Poles, Estonians, Romanians, Finns, Letts, Lapps, Wends, etcetera, and all of them (God help us!) artists. Shall we found a league for the suppression of art? Paris makes me long to. Also, I wish one met a few more heterosexuals for a change. I don’t really like <i xml:lang="fr">ni les tapettes ni les gousses</i>. And since Proust and Gide made them fashionable, one sees nothing else in this tiresome town. All my English respectability breaks out!</p>

				<p>This time your letter was much better. (My only poem, and an accident at that. Rather good, all the same.) If only everybody would realize that being miserable or jolly about love is chiefly a matter of fashion. Being poetically miserable is an old fashion, and besides, the rhymes don’t justify it in English. <i xml:lang="it">Cuore-doloreamore</i>; you can’t escape it in Italian. Nor in German; <i xml:lang="de">Herz</i> must feel <i xml:lang="de">Schmerz</i> and <i xml:lang="de">Liebe</i> is inevitably full of <i xml:lang="de">Triebe</i>. But in English, no. There’s no pain connected with English loves; only gloves and turtle doves. And the only things that, by the laws of poetry, can go straight to Englishmen’s hearts are tarts and amorous arts. And, I assure you, a man’s much better occupied when he’s thinking about those subjects than when he’s telling himself how wretched he is, how jealous, how cruelly wronged, and all the nonsensical rest of it. I wish that idiot René would understand this. But unfortunately <i xml:lang="fr">cœur</i> rhymes with <i xml:lang="fr">douleur</i>, and he’s French. He’s becoming almost as much of a bore as you were, my poor Walter. But I hope you’re now a reformed character. I like you.</p>

				<p>Suffering from a cold and intense boredom, only momentarily relieved by your letter. Paris is really terribly dreary. I have a good mind to fly away somewhere else, only I don’t know where. Eileen came to see me today. She wants to leave Tim, because he will insist on her lying naked in bed while he sets fire to newspapers over her and lets the hot ashes fall on her body. Poor Tim! It seems unkind to deprive him of his simple pleasures. But Eileen’s so nervous of being grilled. She was furious with me for laughing and not being more sympathetic. I took it all as a joke. Which it is. A very mild one, however. For really, like the Queen, we are not amused. How I hate you for not being here to entertain me! One can forgive anything else except absence. Unpardonably absent Walter, goodbye. I have an <i xml:lang="fr">envie</i> for you tonight, for your hands and your mouth. And you! Do you remember?</p>

				<p>So Philip Quarles is going to settle in the country and be a mixture of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Gaskell and Knut Hamsun. Well, well.⁠ ⁠… But it’s good that somebody should have illusions. At any rate, he can’t be more bored in his village than I am here. What straits one’s reduced to! Last night I went with Tim and Eileen, who seems to be reconciled to the firework displays, to one of those places where you pay a hundred francs for the privilege of looking on at orgies (in masks⁠—the one amusing feature) and, if you want to, participating in them. Dim religious lights, little cubicles, divans, a great deal of what the French call <i xml:lang="fr">amour</i> promiscuously going on. Odd and grotesque, but terribly dreary and all so very <em>medical</em>. A sort of cross between very stupid clowns and an operating theatre. Tim and Eileen wanted to stay. I told them I’d rather pay a visit to the morgue, and left them there. I hope they amused themselves. But what a <em>bore</em>, what a hopeless unmitigated <em>bore</em>! I always thought Heliogabalus was such a very sophisticated young person. But now I’ve seen what amused him, I realize that he must have had a mind like a baby’s, really infantile. I have the misfortune to be rather grown up about some things. I’ve a notion of going to Madrid next week. It’ll be terrifically hot, of course. But I love the heat. I blossom in ovens. (Rather a significant intimation of my particular immortality, perhaps?) Why don’t you come with me? Seriously, I mean. You could surely get away. Murder Burlap and come and be a tripper à la Maurice Barres. <i xml:lang="fr">Du sang, de la volupté, et de la mort.</i> I feel rather bloodthirsty at the moment. Spain would suit me. Meanwhile, I’ll make enquiries about the bullfighting season. The ring makes you sick; even my bloodthirstiness won’t run to disembowelled cab horses. But the spectators are marvellous. Twenty thousand simultaneous sadistic frissons. Really remarkable. You simply must come, my sweet Walter. Say yes. I insist.</p>

				<p>It was too sweet of you, Walter darling, to do the impossible⁠—to come to Spain. I wish, for once, you hadn’t taken my momentary <i xml:lang="fr">envie</i> quite so seriously. Madrid’s off⁠—for the present, at any rate. If it should come on again, I’ll let you know at once. Meanwhile, Paris.</p>
